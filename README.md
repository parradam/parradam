# Adam Parr

## A full stack developer in the UK

I enjoy solving complex domain-specific problems using software in areas such as **logistics**, **manufacturing**, and **simulation**.

I plan to use this site to capture lessons learned, book and course reviews, and useful information that I pick up on my programming journey.

My skills are:
- Python
- Django
- TypeScript
- React
